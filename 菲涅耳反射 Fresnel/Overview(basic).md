Perhaps one of the more versatile effects for spatial shaders, fresnel is used for many things. From making water look more natural to simulating rim lighting and even creating force fields.
或许是空间着色器中最为多样化的效果之一，菲涅尔被广泛用于多种用途。从让水看起来更自然，到模拟边缘光照，甚至制造力场。

The fresnel effect is simulating the relationship between a surface’s angle and how much light you will see coming from that surface. The more the surface is pointing away from you the more light you’ll see, creating bright edges.
菲涅耳效应模拟了表面角度与你从该表面看到的光量之间的关系。表面越是朝远，你看到的光越多，边缘会很亮。
